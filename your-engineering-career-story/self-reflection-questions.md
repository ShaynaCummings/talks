# Questions to help self-reflection during your job search

## Personal narrative

- What experiences (personal and professional) brought you here, to this current place in time? What 'bends in the road' have you encountered (and overcome)?
- What are you most proud of? What accomplishments, experiences or talents make your heart swell when you think of them?
- What makes you 'different' or 'special' in your team at work? In your friend group? 
- What's your superpower?
- What kind of tasks give you energy? What makes you excited to get out of bed in the morning? What makes you lose track of time?
- What kind of tasks drain you of energy? What types of jobs/duties do you *not* enjoy?
- Ideally, what does your life look like in 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? Don't pick a role/title, but what does an actual day look like for you?
- If you could be paid $1m per year to do *any* job (tech or otherwise), what would it be and why?

As you think through the answers to the above questions, what themes or patterns arise in your responses? Do they resonate with your sense of self? Do they match how others (colleagues, friends, family) would describe you and your experience?

## Envision your ideal role

- What does your actual day-to-day work consist of? What kind of projects are you working on? What kind of specific tasks fill your day? Back end, front end, test automation? 
- What technologies are you working with? What problems are you solving?
- What is your team composition, and how do you work with them? Are you pair programming? On a tight-knit cross-functional team that's heavy on in-person collaboration? Or solo work with asynchronous communication?
